# This is an Altschool website project created from React that shows all my Github repositories and important Information

- I implemented the **Fetch API**  to _api.github.com_
- I designed a page to show the list of repositories
- I designed another page to show an individual repository clicked from the list of repositories using nested routes
- I implemented proper **SEO**.
- I implemented **Error Boundary**, I designed a page for the error boundary.
- And lastly, I created a **404 page**.

You can preview the website at [Vercel](https://naijadeveloper-github-info-website.vercel.app/).
