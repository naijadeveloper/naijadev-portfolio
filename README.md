# My portfolio website

## This website was created using nextjs 13 pages directory, along with typescript and tailwindcss.

The website's design is simple and straight. It shows a list of the tools I use, a list of my socials so any one can contact me, you can even send an email to me directly through the site. It shows a list of all the fullstack projects that I have built.

**Note: If you like the layout design and you would like to use it, you are free to do so. A simple "hi Enoch" DM, on twitter or linkedin would be nice though, but it is not compulsory.**
